Put the view files here.

The view for a specific controller/action should be inside the pluralized_lowercased_underscored_controller directory and named as lowecased_action.html

For example, for the controller "cars" and action "list_models," there should be a file named list_models.html inside the cars directory inside this view folder.

For wordpress admin views, you may want to wrap the view inside '<div class="wrap"> </div>'
