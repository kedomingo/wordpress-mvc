Before activating this plugin, you need to do a four things:

1) Rename the wpmvc folder inside your plugins directory such that
it is listed FIRST before any other plugins. The way wordpress works is
that it runs through all plugins inside the plugins directory
alphabetically. Failure to do so will prevent wpmvc-based plugins to
fulfill their dependencies to this plugin. For example you can
rename it as "aaaawpmvc" to make sure it is always first in the list.

2) Copy wpmvc_handler.php to your wordpress root directory (the one
containing the folders wp-content, wp-includes, etc).

3) Insert this
code

RewriteRule r/(.+) wpmvc_handler.php [L]

just before the line with "RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]" or something
similar. This is for routing pages.

4) Create a new wordpress page with content "[wpmvc]" (without quotes).
Depending on the permalink generated for this page, you will have to
edit wpmvc_handler.php and change the "wpmvc" in the line

$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] = "{$subfolder}/wpmvc/?{$params}";

to the appropriate permalink.

You can now activate the WPMVC plugin and generate your first WPMVC-
based plugin! Go to Settings > WPMVC, put the name of your first plugin
as "Hello World" and click on Generate Template Project. This copies
the template project to your plugins directory. You can already see
your new plugin in the plugins list. You can activate this and
start developing this plugin.
